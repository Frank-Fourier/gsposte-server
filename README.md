# GSPoste Server

GSPoste project backend REST API

### Project structure

This project is written **entirely** in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). It's built on top of Node.js,
using [Express](https://expressjs.com) as the base framework, but it follows a very different code and file structure.
The database used is MongoDB, using Mongoose to define additional schemas to facilitate ORM. 

The project file structure is as follows:

```

│   │   ├── errors.log # All errors logged in production

#### Writing a new feature

Please follow these steps when you want to write a new feature:
- Ask yourself a question: *Is this new feature going to require the storage of a new model inside the database?*
    - If the answer is **YES**, follow these steps:
        - Create a new Model inside ```src/models/```, following the structure of existing Models. The Schema will
          define how documents are going to be stored inside MongoDB (even if the database itself is loosely-typed).
        - Create a new Service inside ```src/services/``` which extends MongoRepository.
        - Create a new Controller inside ```src/controllers/``` which extends CrudController.
        - Create a new Route inside ```src/routes/``` which extends Route and write the REST bindings to the Controller.
        - **TEST EVERYTHING!** Write tests for the Service and the Route.
        - **DOCUMENTATION!** Write @swagger annotated comments to generate Swagger docs for your new Model and your
          new Route. Plase keep in mind that this project follows Swagger OpenAPI 2.0 written in YAML.
    - If the answer is **NO**, ask yourself another question: *Is this new feature going to add new data inside an
      existing model in the database?*
        - If the answer is **YES**, follow these steps:
            - Modify the existing Model to accomodate for your needs. Remember to also change the @swagger comments!
            - Follow the other branch steps.
        - If the answer is **NO**, ask yourself another question: *Where should I write the code for this new feature?*
            - Inside a Service. Pick the Service most closely related to your new feature and add one (or more)
              functions inside of it. Please keep the number of functions low, otherwise the Services might explode and
              require refactoring by separation of concerns. Write the code for the feature.
            - Add a new method inside the related Controller to call this new feature from the Service.
            - Add a new route REST binding inside the related Route to call the Controller.
            - **TEST THE NEW FEATURE!** Write tests for your new feature (preferably both for the service methods
              themselves and for the REST route bindings, but the latter is not mandatory).
            - **DOCUMENTATION!** Write JSDocs for the new functions you wrote inside a Service. Controller methods do
              not need JSDocs. Write @swagger annoted comments for the new Route you wrote to access the feature.
              
If you actually followed all of these steps, congrats! You just wrote a new feature. I'm proud of you. In case you
didn't follow the steps but wrote a new feature anyways, fuck you that's not a feature that's just your shitcode and I
don't even want to see it. Learn to code you moron.

### Documentation

#### With Swagger
On startup, the server will automatically generate the Swagger API spec and setup a Swagger UI endpoint all on its own!
So just access it at ```{host}:{port}/docs``` while the server is running.

### Develop

This project requires the following packages to be installed on the system: imagemagick, ghostscript, poppler-utils

On Ubuntu:
```shell
$ sudo apt-get install imagemagick ghostscript poppler-utils
```

On OSX:
```shell
$ brew install imagemagick ghostscript poppler
```

On Windows (with [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)):
```shell
$ choco install imagemagick ghostscript poppler
```

Install the dependencies needed to run this project:
```shell
$ yarn install
OR
$ npm install
```

Then, execute the 'dev' command to start the server in development mode!
Live-reload is included.
```shell
$ yarn dev
OR
$ npm run dev
```

### Test

Testing the whole application with Mocha is trivial, just run:
```shell
$ yarn test
OR
$ npm run test
```
To write tests on your own, follow the format of the tests that I already wrote. I want you to follow it strictly!

### Build

Running:
```shell
$ yarn build
OR
$ npm run build
```
Will compile the whole application with tsc in production mode.

You can find the Javascript compiled files in the dist/ directory!

### Deploy with Docker

You should use the orchestrator to deploy this thing. Clone it from gsposte-orch, clone this inside it and run
```shell
docker-compose up -d --build server
```
